Project: Recipes

This project aims to practice basic HTML skills before moving on to CSS and then JavaScript.  Through the use of Github and git, I will become better practiced at tools that will be used daily as a programmer.  Organization will be key.

The HTML portion of the project, while not very difficult, was great practice through redundancy.  It allowed ample opportunity to practice using git commands and practice commits.
