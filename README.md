Project: Recipes

https://jonahhinz.github.io/odin-recipes/

This project aims to practice basic HTML skills before moving on to 
CSS and then JavaScript.  Through the use of Github and git, I will 
become better practiced at tools that will be used daily as a 
programmer.  Organization will be key.

The HTML portion of the project, while not very difficult, was great 
practice through redundancy.  It allowed ample opportunity to practice 
using git commands and practice commits.

POST HTML LEARNING AND IMPLEMENTATION:
This project served as great practice to the use of VS Code, HTML, and 
especially git and command line usage.  Comfort with written in HTML 
has grown significantly.  Structure is understood, and using several 
files and organization and linking has been good practice.

Here was my first solid practice at the use of Git while solely using 
the command line for all file/directory manipulation.  Practice is key 
here, and I submitted over 10 git commits as practice, as well as made, 
moved, and deleted all files and directories through the command line.

MID CSS LEARNING:
After learning some CSS, I was told to revisit this project and add 
some basic CSS to it.  I implemented the concepts learned so far such 
as styling properties such as various colors, typography properties, 
and image properties.  I also made sure to focus on external CSS as 
opposed to internal or inline, for better practice.  The Cascade of 
CSS was taken into account while setting up classes, IDs, and structure 
of the CSS stylesheet.

I am starting to feel very comfortable using the command line and am 
starting to appreciate it and prefer it over using Finder, or file 
explorer.
